INTRODUCTION:
Plant diseases significantly impact agricultural productivity. This project aims to build a robust model capable of detecting diseases from leaf images, helping farmers and agricultural experts diagnose issues early and take preventive measures.

FEATURES:
Trained using a CNN architecture tailored for image classification.
Fine-tuned hyperparameters for optimal performance.
Handles real-world challenges like variations in lighting, image quality, and leaf conditions.
Supports additional datasets for further customization.

DATASET:
The dataset consists of annotated images of plant leaves affected by different diseases. It includes:
Training Set: High-resolution images for model training.
Testing Set: Images for evaluating model performance.
